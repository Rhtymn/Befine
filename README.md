# Machine Learning Section

There is 2 model of machine learning in this repository, there are recommender system and search engine. 

The recommender system in Recommender_Systems_using_KMeans.ipynb notebook using TF-IDF and KMeans algorithm with 15 clusters and will provide 10 of recommendation based on 150 datasets in data_bengkel.csv file. The saved model of the recommender system is saved in recommender_system.h5

We are utilizing TF-IDF and LSI models in our NLP Search Engine that applied in Semantic_Search_Engine_Using_NLP.ipynb notebook, which is implemented within our application. The Search Engine generates the top 5 results that best match the provided keyword within our dataset in data_bengkel.csv file. Indexing was saved in alamat_lsi_model_mm.index and alamat_tfidf_model_mm.index.
